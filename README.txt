# RetroRunnerDemo-0.1

Hey! Thank you for taking the time to help me! ReadMe's are boring so I will get straight to the point:

This is strictly a gameplay demo. There will be A LOT of changes to how the game looks before final release
(which is many months away). Plus obviously, more level environments.

Basics:
The screen is divided into two: Touch the top to pause and open the menu. The rest of the screen below
is for gameplay purposes. 
You can jump to any level in the pause menu and also restart at any time.
After the two tutorial levels, each level has two coins to collect (currently rewards nothing!) These are 
intended to be optional and difficult - There are two hiddens ones that I would like you to try and find!
The final checkpoint of each level waits for you to touch the screen and then loads the next.
Also, there is no sound so far. Sorry!

Glitches that may occur:
Player falls through floor when respawning... Also, the checkpoints can sometime glitch :( I can't currently 
think of any more so let me know if you find some!

Once you have finished with it, if you could fill in this short, easy survey, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
