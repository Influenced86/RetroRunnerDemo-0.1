# RetroRunnerDemo-0.1

Hey! Thank you for taking the time to help me! ReadMe's are boring so I will get straight to the point:

This is strictly a gameplay demo. There will be A LOT of changes to how the game looks before final release
(which is many months away). Plus obviously, more level environments.

Instructions: 

WINDOWS: (HAS TEXTURE ISSUES FOR UNKNOWN REASONS)
Recommended Resolution: 1768 x 992 
The Windows version is for easy Gameplay testing, rather than having testers be forced to transfer the 
file from PC to phone, or download the file via this link from a phone. Simply unzip and open the .exe 
file.

ANDROID: (TEXTURES LOOK AS THEY SHOULD)
The "RetroRunnerAlphaGameplayDemo02.apk" game file is for Android only. This means you can either 
play it on your Android phone, or emulator on PC if you have one. So you would either have to download
the file via your phone, or transfer it from your PC. Pain in the arse, I know - Sorry.

Basics:
The screen is divided into two: Touch the top to pause and open the menu. The rest of the screen below
is for gameplay purposes. 
You can jump to any level in the pause menu and also restart at any time.
After the two tutorial levels, each level has two coins to collect (currently rewards nothing!) These are 
intended to be optional and difficult - There are two hiddens ones that I would like you to try and find!
The final checkpoint of each level waits for you to touch the screen and then loads the next.
Also, there is no sound so far. Sorry!

Glitches that may occur:
Player falls through floor when respawning... Also, the checkpoints can sometime glitch :( I can't currently 
think of any more so let me know if you find some!

Once you have finished with it, if you could fill in this short, easy survey, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
